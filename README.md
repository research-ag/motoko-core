> **Work in progress! Please consider providing feedback on the [GitHub discussions page](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-core/discussions)**. 

#### ✨ [Documentation preview](https://dfinity.github.io/motoko-core)

---

This repository contains the standard library for the [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko) programming language. 

The original standard library (known as "base") is available [here](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-base).

## Quick Start

A preview of the core library is available via the [`new-base`](https://mops.one/new-base) Mops package.

You can quickly try out the core library by making the following change to your `mops.toml` config file:

```toml
core = "0.5.0"
```

It's also possible to use the latest changes in the GitHub repository:

```toml
core = "https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-core"
```

Since this is a preview release for community feedback, expect breaking changes.
Please report any bugs or inconsistencies by opening a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-core/issues). 

## Local Environment

Make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) `>= 22.x` and the latest version of [`dfx`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/getting-started/install) are installed on your system.

```sh
# First-time setup
git clone https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-core

Below is a quick reference for commonly-used scripts during development:

```sh
npm test # Run all tests
