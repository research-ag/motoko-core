---

This repository contains the source code for a revamped [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko) base library. 

If you are new to Motoko, the original base library is available [here](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-base).

## Quick Start

A preview of the new base library is available via the [`new-base`](https://mops.one/new-base) Mops package.

You can quickly try out the new base library by making the following change to your `mops.toml` config file:

```toml
base = "https://github.com/dfinity/new-motoko-base"
```

It's also possible to start using both versions in parallel:

```toml
base = "0.14.4"
new-base = "0.4.0"
```

Since this is a preview release for community feedback, expect breaking changes.
Please report any bugs or inconsistencies by opening a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dfinity/new-motoko-base/issues). 

## Local Environment

```sh
# First-time setup
